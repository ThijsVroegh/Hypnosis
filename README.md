# Hypnosis
The phenomenology of hypnosis: A meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach

# Summary
In this blog, I test an experiential model of hypnosis using a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach (MASEM). With Bayesian network structure learning, I use a data-driven technique to examine how the initial model as proposed by Rainville and Price (2003), when slightly restructured, can be further improved.

# Background
During my PhD and postdoc centered around the theme of music-induced absorption, I regularly came across the related subject of hypnosis. In this blog I want to explore this exciting subject in more detail.

In contrast to music, hypnosis is centered on the response to a usually _verbal induction_ procedure by a clinician/experimenter that can, after following more specific suggestions, elicit changes in ideomotor, perceptual, cognitive, or emotional features and often leads to corresponding changes in subjective experience and observable behavior (Kihlstrom, 2008; Nash & Barnier, 2008). It is as a form of effortless, absorbed awareness with a present-moment focus in which imagination is often prominent (Thompson, Waeld, Tisza & Spiegel, 2016) and encouraged by suggestions, often identified by a sense of automaticity (i.e., feeling of loss of control) and reduced self-orientation (Rainville & Price, 2003).

To better understand the mechanisms that 'drive' hypnosis, Rainville and Price (2003) proposed an experiential model of hypnosis' subjective experience build around the following dimensions which, when taken together, particularly characterize the feeling of being hypnotized:

__1.__ Feeling _relaxed_ with no arousal at all.

__2.__ _Absorbed attention_ while being engaged in the hypnotic process.

__3.__ A relative absence of _self-monitoring_/ _self-awareness_.

__4.__ An alteration in experience marked by _a loss in the perception of time and place_.

__5.__ Feelings of automaticity, effortlessness or sense of _loss in volitional control_.

Lastly, the authors assumed that the loss in volitional control and alterations in experience were the main contributors in

__6.__ the self-perceived _depth_ of the hypnotic experience. 

Specifically, the experiential model of hypnosis looks like this:

The authors further remark that, "In this model, functional interactions are proposed in which changes in distinct experiential dimensions precede changes in other dimension following the sequence of arrows" (...) where "these successive interactions need not reflect a strict temporal sequence but rather indicate a general functional interaction" (p.112). In other words, the model represents the hypothesized conditional independences between the main dimensions of hypnotic experience.

Except for the authors themselves, and despite the fact that the article is almost 20 years old, this model has never been tested thoroughly. This blog will therefore takes up this challenge. 

# Question
Do data on the subjective experience of being hypnotized fit the experiential model of hypnosis as originally formulated by Rainville and Price? How can a data-driven approach help further in identifying and adopting an alternative, better fitting but equally plausible model?
